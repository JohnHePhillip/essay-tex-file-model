\subsection{Problem 22}

Approach 1: Ask him/her Which number is equal to one plus one. If he/she say two then he/she is a truth teller, otherwise he/she is a liar.

Approach 2: Ask him/her to write down the answer of "Which person are you, a truth teller or a liar?" on a paper, then tell you the words written on it. As a result, what he told you is the identity of him.

\subsection{Problem 24}

The halting problem shows that there are some problems that couldn't be solved by machines, which means the capabilities of machines is limited.

\subsection{Problem 25}

During we asking all the people, there exists at least people answering that his/her birthday is on that day.

After we asking all the people, there wasn't any people answering that his/her birthday is on that day.

We can enumerate all the positive numbers from 0 to bigger, if there exists some number we wanted, we will find it eventually. However, the time of this algorithm may be infinite.

I think we can't solve this problem.

\subsection{Problem 32}



\subsection{Problem 35}

``Select three numbers between 1 and 100." is nondetermin.

``Select one of the chosen numbers and give that number as the answer" is nondetermin.

\subsection{Problem 36}

The algorithm has a poly-nomial complexity.Because "Pick a collection of numbers" will take at last $O(n)$ time and check if the sum of these numbers is equal to 125 takes also $O(n)$ time. So the total complexity of the algorithm is $O(n)$.

\subsection{Problem 43}

Polynomial problems: Sorting an list of numbers
Nonpolynomial problems: Travelling salesman problem
Unsolvable problems: The Halting problem

\subsection{Problem 45}

The answer is "257, 771, 391, 304".

My algorithm is to enumerate all the subset of the list and check if their sum is equal to 1723. The complexity is $O(2^n *n )$.

\subsection{Problem 50}

The private key is 43.

In this case, n is small enough to find $p=7$ and $q=11$ so that $p*q = n$ in a $O(n)$ time. After that, we can find the private key d which satisfys $d*e = k(p-1)(q-1) +1$ with a extended-Euclidean Algorithm.

\subsection{Problem 4}

Suppose the variable X is tored in the memory cell whose address is 1A, while Y is 1B, and Z 1C, W 1D.

\begin{lstlisting}
2000
111A
121B
131D
B10E
5412
B010
5423
341C
C000
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Problem 22}

\begin{lstlisting}
CASE W IS
  WHEN 5=> Z:=7;
  WHEN 6=> Y:=7;
  WHEN 7=> X:=7;
END CASE;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Problem 33}

This sentence can represent X = (3+2) *5 or X = 3+(2*5),either.

\subsection{Problem 45}

First of all, we can load 2 to a register. Then we can predict that X equals to 5 so that we can let compute Z by X + 2. If X doesn't equal to 5, we can let Z be Z + 2 then. In this way, we only need to load 2 to the register.
